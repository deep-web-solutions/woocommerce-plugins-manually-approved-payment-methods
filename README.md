## Frequently Asked Questions

- Will you support earlier versions of WordPress and PHP?

Unfortunately not. PHP 7.3 is close to EOL (March 2021), and we consider 7.4 to provide a few features that are absolutely amazing.
Moreover, WP 5.5 introduced a few new features that we really want to use as well, and we consider it to be one of the first versions
of WordPress to have packed a more-or-less mature version of Gutenberg.

If you're using older versions of either one, you should really consider upgrading at least for security reasons.

- Is this bug-free?

Hopefully yes, probably not. If you found any problems, please raise an issue on Github!
